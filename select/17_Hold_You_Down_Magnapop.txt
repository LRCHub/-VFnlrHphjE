I'm the greatest test
You'll never know
I could tell you things
You think don't show
I could kick your legs
Out from under you
Take you down
Torture you
Deliberately
Confuse you
Deliberately
Use you
I could take you home
And abuse you
You can't hurt me
But I could hurt you
I could hold you down
Hell bound
I could hold you down
Hell bound
I could hold you down
Hell bound
I could hold you down
I could tie you up
Tear you in two
I could crucify you
I choose not to
I could hurt you
Slice you in two
With my tongue
Nicely knife you
Deliberately
Confuse you
Deliberately
Use you
I could take you home and abuse you
You can't hurt me
But I could hurt you
I could hold you down
Hell bound
(Repeat 2x)
I could hold you down
I could hold you down
Hell bound
(Repeat 4x)
I could hold you down
